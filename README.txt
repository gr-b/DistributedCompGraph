Project 3 - Distributed Computation/Threading/Mutex

The graph program reads in a "graph" where each line contains the name
of a node, the name of the nodes it relies on, the time required for 
computation, and the result of the node's computation.
The second part of the program allows it to do the above, but also 
implements computing actual operations based on Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix notation)



Usage: "make" and then "./graph <filename>"

There are several test graph test files that may be used, located in the examples directory:
ex1
ex2
ex3
ex4
ex5
ex6
ex7
ex8
